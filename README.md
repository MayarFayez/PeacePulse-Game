### 1.LifeLine  
A rope serves as a symbol of the child's life with stones and flowers, in different sizes and colors, representing good (joyful, happy) and bad (sad, fearful) events occurring during the child's life.   
### 2.Narrative exposure therapy 
- The traumatic event is discussed then written and read at the next session to ensure content is correct.  
- Questions to be asked and to expose them to it again.

### 3.Anxiety Management  
- Interventions that are geared to reduce the level of anxiety and overall distress.   
- Various techniques, such as breathing retraining, deep muscle relaxation and thought stopping.

### Body Pose Tracking 
-Analyze and track a person's body movements in real-time.  
-Therapists can use the real-time body tracking data to provide feedback to the patient.
